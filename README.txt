These are the benchmarks for the CAV '18 JKind paper. They are based
on earlier benchmarks by Alessandro Cimatti, Alberto Griggio, Sergio
Mover and Stefano Tonetta. The original benchmark set has been reduced
by removing duplicate files.

Run the benchmarks with `run.sh`. The benchmarks for nuXmv will
require manual tweaks as described in `run.sh`. Generate the results
plot with `results/make-plot.sh` which must be run from inside the
`results` directory.
